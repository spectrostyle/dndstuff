me playing around with what ive learned so far in python

to use this, i would first make sure character_Stats.txt is empty

then load testcombat.py
this should start character creation process.
you can continually reroll until a desired outcome
then asssign points

afterwards, i currently display yours stats vs a rando monster from monsterstats.csv
calculates hp

will do soe more modules to make, clsses, etc.
havig fun atm.
